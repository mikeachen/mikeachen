                <h3>Colleen Green: I Want to Grow Up</h3>
                <p>Colleen Green's 2015 LP helped me realize that growing up isn't about changing the way you act. It's about learning to love and accept yourself, and embracing the paradox that you can be happy with yourself and still be going places. It's a really important record to me, so I finally sat down and wrote a radio essay about it. Check it out if you've ever wondered when life is gonna feel the way it's supposed to!</p>
