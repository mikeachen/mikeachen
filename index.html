                </h3>
                <p>Growing up isn't about changing the way you act. It's about learning to love and accept yourself, and embracing the paradox that you can be happy with yourself and still be going places. Colleen Green's 2015 LP helped me realize that. It's a really important record to me, so I wrote and recorded radio essay about it. Check it out if you've ever wondered when life is gonna feel the way it's supposed to!</p>

                <p>I'd been meaning to try streaming for a while, so the release of <a href="http://firewatchgame.com/" target="_blank"><i>Firewatch</i></a>, one of my most anticipated games of the year, was the perfect chance to try it out! While it didn't go totally smoothly, it was interesting and I learned a lot from it!</p>
